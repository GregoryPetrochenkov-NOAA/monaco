## [Monaco](../) - Examples

### [Early Retirement Investment Portfolio](early_retirement_investment_portfolio/)
Models an investment portfolio's balance during a retirement drawn-down, and calculates the likelihood of going broke. A good look at using pandas for time series data, generating input variables algorithmically, and using correlation coefficients meaningfully.

### [Election](election/)
Models probabalistic outcomes for the 2020 US Presidential election, based on state-level odds from 538's polling data and nationwide swings. A good example of passing in constant data via addConstVal, adding and plotting order statistics, and using a monte-carlo in general to inform further data processing.

### [Evidence-Based Scheduling](evidence_based_scheduling/)
TODO. Based on [this](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/).

### [Integration](integration/)
TODO. Will show monte-carlo integration.

### [Pandemic](pandemic/)
Models the spread of a virus through a scale-free network using an SIR model. A good look at using order statistics to figure out how many cases to run, passing random seeds to a program during preprocessing, and some more complicated postprocessing.

### [Rocket](rocket/)
Models the flight of a model rocket for varying environmental conditions and performance characteristics. A useful example for looking at more complicated program inputs and outputs, and postprocessing that data into mcoutvars of different shapes and types.
